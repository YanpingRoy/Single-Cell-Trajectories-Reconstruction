Single-Cell Trajectories Reconstruction Reveals Migration Potential of Cell Populations;
You can start the analysis or simulation by running the script "Start_Analyzing.m" in software MATLAB;
The experiment data of D. discoideum and MDA-MB-231 cells are obtained from the previously puslished paper (DOI:10.1038/nature12611);
Some data of the MDA-MB-231 cells are selected for ensuring that all selected trajectories have the same frames.
